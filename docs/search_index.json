[["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Plots", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. 2.1 Plots p_static &lt;- ecoidx::plot_ts(ts1) p_interactive &lt;- ecoidx::plot_ts(ts1, add_icons = F) %&gt;% plotly::ggplotly() 2.1.1 Static p_static Figure 2.1: The index changed by less than one standard deviation of the full time series over the last 5 years (indicated by icon: →). The mean of the last 5 years was more than one standard deviation below the mean of the full time series (indicated by icon: +). 2.1.2 Interactive p_interactive Figure 2.2: The index changed by less than one standard deviation of the full time series over the last 5 years (indicated by icon: →). The mean of the last 5 years was more than one standard deviation below the mean of the full time series (indicated by icon: +). Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "]]
